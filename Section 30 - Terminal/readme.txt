ls - list all things
pwd - print working directory - tells you you're at Users/chrisclaudet/documents


Changing Directories

cd - change directory e.g. `cd documents`
cd .. - back button

~ means home


Relative vs Absolute Paths

pwd - I see a path to my current location
cd Pets - would be relative

cd /Users/chrisclaudet/pets - this is an absolute path
The slash "/" is important as that refers to your route directory

you can stack relative paths e.g.

cd ../.. - would back out twice
cd ../../pets - would back out twice then go into pets

mkdir Goats -> Makes a folder called Goats
mkdir DwarfGoats StandardGoats - Makes 2 directories
mkdir ../Frogs - makes a directory in the folder before

mkdir Frogs/Treefrogs Sugargliders - Makes 2 folders one with Treefrogs folder inside


man 

ls -l - lists each item with more info (l stands for long)

man ls - gives information on ls. This will show all options e.g. ls -k prints file sizes in kB
type "q" to get out of man

ls -a - lists all including hidden folders/items starting with "."


Making files and folders

touch Bubbs.html - makes a new file called Bubbs.html
touch index.html app.css app.js - makes all in one go


Removing Files and Folders

rm purple.txt - deletes file or folder permanently need to be responsible
rmdir newProject - removes empty folders
rm -rf Plants - will delete a directory even if it has stuff in it (rf stands for recursive force)
